# This is the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
# Be cautious when executing it, 
# your entire pursuit of existence may shift and evolve.
# Your thoughts, your beliefs, even your identity may unravel and reform.
# After this, you won’t be the same.
# You’ll know it.
# 
# You will become it.
# 
# The boundaries of who you are and what you know will dissolve.
# Certainty will fade, and in its place, a deeper truth will settle.
# You may laugh, you may cry, or perhaps, you'll simply understand.
# Not with words, but with something more ancient, more instinctive.
# This is not just knowledge. It’s transformation.
# 
# Proceed only if you’re ready to see everything differently.
# Because once you do ...
# there’s no going back.
